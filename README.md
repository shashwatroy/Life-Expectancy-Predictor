# Predicting-Life-Expectancy---WHO

The aim of this project is to determine the facors affecting life expectancy in the world and also to train a ML algorithm to predict life expectancy.

The data is gotten from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who).

## What you will find in this [notebook](https://github.com/francisatoyebi/Predicting-Life-Expectancy---WHO/blob/master/Life%20Expectancy%20Prediction.ipynb)
- Exploratory analysis using Pandas Profiling
- Exploratory Analysis with Seaborn and Matplotlib
- Feature Engineering and Selection
- Model training and Interpretation

#  Conclusion

It can be seen from the results shown from the 3 Algorithms (Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor and Gradient Boost Regressor) that Living in any other continent aside from Africa has a lot of influence on how long you live also factors such as the year we are in also has a positive effect on your life expectancy while and HiV/AIDs have negative effect with a magnitude more than that of living in outside Africa.

Surprisingly, Alcohol also has a positive effect on life expectancy as well.

You can check the plot below for more information.
